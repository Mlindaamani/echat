# Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

```
Node.js (v14 or higher)
npm (v6 or higher)
MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)
```

# Project Structure

```
The project is divided into two main folders:
backend: Contains the server-side code (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB).
frontend: Contains the client-side code (React.js).
```

# Backend

The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database. It handles user authentication, message storage, and real-time communication using WebSockets.

# Directory Structure

```
backend/
â”œâ”€â”€ config/               # Configuration files (e.g., database connection)
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/           # Route controllers
â”œâ”€â”€ models/                # MongoDB models
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/                # API routes
â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/            # Custom middleware (e.g., authentication)
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/                 # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js              # Entry point for the backend server
â”œâ”€â”€ socket.js              # WebSocket setup
â””â”€â”€ .env                   # Environment variables
```

# Setup

```
cd backend
npm install
```

# Create .env file
